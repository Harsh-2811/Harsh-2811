### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Harsh Pagtel, a passionate software developer with expertise in Python, Django, Flask, FastAPI, and JavaScript. I love building efficient and scalable web applications, and I'm particularly interested in using OpenAI Services such as Image Generation, Function Calling, Automate stuffs, and many more use cases.

ðŸš€ Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of full-stack development, exploring the latest trends and tools to craft robust and user-friendly applications. Whether it's backend development with Django or Flask, frontend magic with JavaScript, or API development with DRF and FAST API, I enjoy every aspect of the software development lifecycle.

ðŸŒ± I'm always eager to learn and collaborate on exciting projects, so feel free to reach out if you're looking for a teammate or need assistance on any Python-related projects. Let's code something amazing together!

ðŸ“« You can connect with me on GitHub or reach out via email hrpatel8935@gmail.com. Let's build the future of technology together, one line of code at a time!
